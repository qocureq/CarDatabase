# Car Database

A simple database project developed I made to practise TDD.

It gathers data about cars such as:
* Brand
* Model
* (optional) Generation
* (optional) Type
* Production year
* Color
* Engine capacity
* Engine power
* Mileage
* Price in PLN

* Search by more/less than x value
* Search within range of x,y values
